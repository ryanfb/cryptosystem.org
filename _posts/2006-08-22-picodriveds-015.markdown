    <p>Good work with this new version of the picodriveDS, the speed is increased! :)
    But on the M3 mini SD it doesn't work again... :(
    If you want I can help you to test it on a M3 Mini SD! ;)</p>

    <p>@ RyanFB (This is your emulator right?)</p>
    
    <p>Nice update. The speed increase is really nice. Many thanks.</p>
    
    <p>Oh and thanks for fixing the M3 reset code. I think that had something to do with the glitched line in the menu in picodrive 0.1.4. I'm not sure what the "M3SD Mini insertion detection code" is but if you can inform me on what it does I can gladly test it for you (:</p>

    <li>Put all roms and the nds file in the root of the ds</li>

    <p>or</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>Put the roms in a folder called Roms</li>

    <p>This release has made a significant increase in the speed most of my games run at. Pretty much full speed.</p>
    
    <p>Are we likely to have sound in future releases? Or is it pretty much impossible to do?</p>

    <p>What the crap?  How do I get this thing to find my games?  I have a Supercard CF.  I've tried putting the games into the root and in a folder named Roms, but neither work.  When I boot up PicoDriveDS, all I get is:</p>
    
    <p>"Appended ROM check...FOUND SMD!"</p>
    
    <p>And that's it.  Touch screen does nothing, buttons do nothing (other than the power button :P)</p>

    <p>Zero Wing is no longer playable.  It crashes right when you enter the playable part.  The menus and stuff are fine though.  Dissipointing because it worked fine on PicoDriveDS 0.1.4</p>

    <p>I tried it in a command prompt, and it says that it cannot find the file specified.  I had the picodriveds.nds and the picodriveds.ds.gba on my desktop, along with the rom in .bin format.  What I typed in was this:
    "copy /b picodriveds.nds+Mega Turrican (U) [!].bin picodriveds-Mega Turrican (U) [!].bin"</p>

    <p>I just found the .ds.gba file XD</p>
    
    <p>That is what is needed for the M3 MiniSD to run it right.  Before, all I saw were the .nds.gba and .nds files.  I want to thank the coder for updating this thing regularly, but I must add that the games are still glitchy.  I have tested Castlevania Bloodlines and M.U.S.H.A.(my favorite shooter) and both had transparency issues.  I also tested Zombies ate my neighbors, it worked fine, though a little slow.  I've also not gotten any sound out of the emulator yet, is sound not yet supported for the M3 port?</p>

    <p>Oh my god! Finally! I'm the one that was infinitely having the problems with the M3 Mini SD. It's finally working. Your post said you weren't sure if it works; it does. All we need now is sound and a little more speed (<em>prays</em>).</p>
    
    <p>Oh and btw, there's this glitch that I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced. When playing Sonic 3, atleast on the first level, if I'm near the bottom of the stage, the colors change to "under water" colors (with the green tint to everything). Was this present in the other versions of Picodrive? (It's fine when I'm actually under water, but when I even get close to the bottom of the stage, not under water, it happens)</p>

    <p>Any chance that the 6 button controller could be emulated? Curently you have push start to swap between "A,B,C" and "X,Y,Z"  It would really help in Steet Fighter II Turbo.</p>

    <p>Awesome stuff...</p>
    
    <p>But think you can code in support for roms over 4mb, OR port the Picodrive found on http://umk3.hacking-cult.org/ ?  It's at the way bottom.</p>
    
    <p>I tried to mail you it, but it couldn't go through.</p>
    
    <p>Also, think a control scheme could be...</p>
    
    <p>Touch Screen for Savestate and Load Rom and such...</p>
    
    <p>Genesis     DS
    A         =    Y
    B         =    B
    C         =    A
    X         =    L
    Y         =    X
    Z         =    R
    Start    =  Start
    Mode   =  Select</p>

    <p>I finally discovered what causes the major graphical errors during a race in Super Hang-On!</p>
    
    <p>In either Arcade or Original mode, when it asks you to choose the track music, you can choose the following:</p>
    
    <p>Outride a Crisis
    Sprinter
    Winning Run
    Hard Road</p>
    
    <p>Oddly enough, choosing "Outride a Crisis" or "Hard Road" results in major graphical errors during the race.  NO idea why though... Not really a major problem now though, since we don't have any sound yet :P  Just make sure you select "Sprinter" or "Winning Run".</p>

I had it in 'bin' format, but it wouldn't load, so I converted it to smd, and still the same error, pictured here: http://hosted.thegroupofthey.com/son3kerror.jpg I downloaded a fresh copy of the rom, and same jazz. This problem on my end, or the emulators'?</p>

    <p>I've tried to get PicoDriveDS to work on my DS with a Supercard CF, but to no avail.</p>
    
    <p>I've tried each of the versions (.1.2, .1.3, .1.4, and .1.5), with and without appending working .bin and .smd roms (like altered beast, afterburner 2, and space harrier), in the root of my CF card or in a Genesis folder, and with and without the roms in the same folders.  I've looked at and followed any suggestions in all the threads in the message boards I can find (like gbadev, emutalk, emuboards, dcemu, etc).</p>
    
    <p>Each time I only get a white screen.  Has anyone gotten any version fo PicoDriveDS working on their Supercard CF?  If so, can you post a quick step-by-step here?</p>

    <p>Are you using the .nds file?  Because that will not work, you need to use the .ds.gba and rename it to .nds (or something like .ds.nds to make note that it was originally a .ds.gba)</p>

    <p>PicoDriveDS 0.1.5 wont save to my supercard lite's microSD but it saves just fine to my supercard SD card. 
    the problem with both Save States and SRAM. I think it's due to the FAT Libs not being compatible with the MiniSD for the SuperCard Lite.</p>

    <p>This is probably a stupid question with a simple answer, but whenever I load up pictodrive, it says 'Establishing ROM check' for a split second, and then there's just a black screen.
    Would anyone mind guiding me through how to properly install the emulator and play roms?</p>

title: PicoDriveDS 0.1.5

---
PicoDriveDS 0.1.5 is up! Changes:

   * Added support for appended ROMs. This should allow users with carts not supported by gba_nds_fat to use PicoDriveDS. Simply append a ROM to the PicoDriveDS binary, and it will run it (on *nix systems this can be done with "cat romname.ext >> picodriveds.ext", on Windows with "copy /b picodriveds.ext+romname.ext picodriveds-withrom.ext", substituting the appropriate filenames of course). You can only append one ROM at a time. In this mode, Genesis SRAM will be saved to GBA SRAM. Some patchers may work correctly with this and save the SRAM to your removable media, I have only been able to test with the EZ4 Lite software.
   * Fixed M3 reset code, added M3SD Mini insertion detection code (untested, may not work)
   * Massive code restructure and cleanup (though some cleanup is still in progress)
   * Added save state support, accessed via the X button. Due to the current size of the save states, this is only supported for FAT devices and is disabled in appended ROM mode. Currently there is only one save state per ROM (saved to romname.pds). This is still a very experimental feature and save states may not be compatible with future versions of PicoDriveDS.

Grab it [here](http://cryptosystem.org/projects/nds/picodriveds-0.1.5/) or in the usual location. The source code tarball is also in the release directory, and I will check in the code to [the PicoDriveDS Bounty Source project](https://picodriveds.bountysource.com/) repository soon and begin using that as my primary Subversion server.
