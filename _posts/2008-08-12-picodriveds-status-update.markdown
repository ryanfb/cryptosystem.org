If you haven't noticed by now, other commitments have reduced the time I have to work on projects like PicoDriveDS. My original intent was just to show that DS was capable of Genesis emulation at >1fps (and learn a bit about the DS hardware in the process of porting), and I think in that I succeeded. The PicoDriveDS files will stay up here, but I don't plan on working on it again anytime soon. The source is [as always still available](https://picodriveds.bountysource.com/) for anyone who wants to look at it or fork it.

[jEnesisDS](http://www.workingdesign.de/projects/jenesisds.php) is a more recently updated Genesis emulator for the DS, with sound emulation and other features.
