So [there's](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=165343) [this](https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=5764) [really](http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-7737.html) [annoying](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=75400) [bug](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/beta/show_bug.cgi?id=139167) [that](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/beta/show_bug.cgi?id=138967) [a](https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1390) [lot](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=271259) of GNOME users have been experiencing, including myself. The first issue is that the default GNOME layout binds the "Windows" key to Super\_L/Super\_R, which prevents you from using it as a modifier key. This is a relatively easy fix; run `gnome-keyboard-properties` and change "Layout Options->Alt\Win Behavior" to "Meta is mapped to the Win-keys" (or just about anything other than "Default", apparently). Now, you can open up `gnome-keybinding-properties` and use away. But wait! It mysteriously only works for some of the actions. This is because essentially two keybinding backends are used, gnome-settings-daemon and metacity. Turns out, gnome-settings-daemon ignores Mod4 (which is what the Windows key gets mapped to as a Meta). Thankfully, it's an easy fix! Grab my [patch](http://cryptosystem.org/projects/mod4/gnome-settings-daemon.patch) or if you're running Ubuntu/Debian, you can install [these deb's](http://cryptosystem.org/projects/mod4/customdebs/) which already have the patch applied and restart GNOME (these have only been tested on Ubuntu Hoary). Now, rejoice that you can finally have Windows+L mapped to "lock screen"!
