    <p>Hi RyanB*Great work even I haven't try this release. Could you make some speed increase ? I can't wait to play Thunderforce 4 with "full speed" and sound ! (maybe you can use the picodrive source for GP2X to help you).</p>

    <p>doesn't work for me.. :( i use SUPERKEY2 and SUPERCARD with CF on DS lite
    the files load and freeze at 600 on 704  (i use .ds.gba file because the other don't work for me)</p>

    <p>just use the .ds.gba and rename it .nds Crossout.
    Ryan I've just try it and it's incredible. Thunder Force 4 is near full speed (as I can see). I cna't wait the next release that, I hope, will have full speed and even maybe sound :)</p>

    <p>ok that right , i needed to rename GBA to NDS  (i forget this detail..)
    speed is better than the 1.5 (i test with Street of rage 1.2 and3 and Best of the best) version but no sound yet ...hope in the next version ;)
    some little trouble to change game with the SELECT button...
    this emulator is in the good way!!</p>

    <p>Put NHL 94 in for it to use. It seems to run for a couple of seconds, then freeze for 10 or so. Obviously that's a bit of a handicap:)</p>

    <p>What do you expect, Bonic? I think it's nice that PicoDriveDS supports MMD now, but people who use M3, SC (like me) or any other gadget won't be able to appreciate your work.</p>
    
    <p>Anyhow: thanks to everyone who contributed to this emulator, and keep up the good work. Happy now? ;)</p>

    <p>I think the comment I left for 0.1.5, the 6 Button Config.  That would be the best!</p>
    
    <p>And, if it's possible, figure out how to make http://umk3.hacking-cult.org/ work.</p>

    <p>Guys, the original picodrive, which has been ported, never included sound support. I have no idea what chip it uses but I can guarantee you that emulating it from scratch is no mean feat. Plus, if you don't like the speed now, how do you think you'll feel when it's trying to emulate sound as well? The DS isn't a very powerful little machine, and even getting it to run faster will take some pretty nifty memory management.....so cut the guy some slack, hey? It's a great and, more importantly, the ONLY Megadrive emulator for the DS.</p>

    <p>Hi Bonic!</p>
    
    <p>Just a little question! do you think that it is possible to macke an Amiga emulator like uae, without windows manager (amiga os) on DS (just launching amiga games) ? I think that because of the similarity of those hardware...</p>
    
    <p>I'm fond of megadrive and amiga, and i'm very happy to find some amiga games on genesis ! (with picodrive)!</p>

    <p>On my SC Micro SD Lite, I can only run picodrive under Moonshell. Works perfectly (more than 300 games tested). Maybe it would solve most of the SC problems described here. Great job, fellows! Thanks a lot, Genesis was so important for me. :)</p>

    <p>The emu it self works on the R4DS card but does not find the roms which are also on the microsd card, do you have to put them in a folder or patch them?</p>

    <p>Any help would be great, thanks</p>

title: PicoDriveDS 0.1.6
wordpress_url: http://www.cryptosystem.org/archives/2006/11/picodriveds-016/
---
PicoDriveDS 0.1.6 is up! Changes:

*   Added Max Media Dock FAT support (thanks chishm/Bonic)
*   Added EZ4 FAT support (thanks cory1492/Rudolph)
*   Reduced memory usage, 3MB ROMs should work again
*   Added EXPERIMENTAL support for using the additional RAM on SuperCard SD carts to load ROMs larger than 3MB. This comes with the standard warning that this feature may cause file corruption on your SD card. The SCSD may also keep the Genesis ROM in GBA ROM space after a reboot, causing PicoDriveDS to see it as an appended ROM and crash on startup - to fix this issue simply power down, take the SCSD out, and wait a few seconds.

Grab it [here](http://www.cryptosystem.org/projects/nds/picodriveds-0.1.6/) or in the usual location.
