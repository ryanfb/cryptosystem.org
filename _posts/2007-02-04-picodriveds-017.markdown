    <p>Awesome. I've been really looking forward to this. Does the opera ram support provide a speed increase? If it does, I might have to buy the web browser (=</p>

    <p>Hi,</p>
    
    <p>Will you add M3 lite ram support ?</p>
    
    <p>the emu is running quite good and keep up the good work. :)</p>

    <p>Nice to see some new releases :)
    Havoc_012 : It will not increase speed, it will allow you to load some big roms that can't be loaded elseway (because internal DS' RAM is not big enough).
    I own the opera expention card, but i'm using a SLOT2 flashcard so I can't test it with this release :(</p>

    <p>I use M3 SD.</p>
    
    <p>Seems speed is better. New menu selection works, but i can't load another game when one is loaded.</p>
    
    <p>Save states works fine for stable games.</p>
    
    <p>Compatibility seems the same.</p>
    
    <p>Most strange graphical bugs: assault suit leynos / target earth.</p>

    <p>I can barely put into words how freaking cool it is playing streets of rage, golden axe and micro machines on my ds. Awesome work, seriously.
    About the only suggestion I could add would be adding support for expanded ram with the m3 slot2 cards (similar to the opera support).
    If you ever want some help with menus/logos or other graphics get in touch too :)</p>

    <p>First of all thanks for this emulator.  Playing Sonic on my DS with save states is great!  I wanted to ask you if you had ever talked to the guys who have been working on a Dreamcast Genesis emulator for a good while. It's taken years but they finally have good speed and sound and may have some tips to help you improve this even more.  Here's a link to a long thread about it:  http://dcemulation.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=89951</p>

    <p>Decided to give this a try as I fancied playing Goldenaxe - downloaded the file and put it on my supercard SD (renamed the .gba.nds file to .nds otherwise I just get a white screen) along with a goldenaxe2.smd file (in the same directory)  but I just get a black screen with the following messages:</p>
    
    <p>Trying to init FAT...
    FAT init failed.
    Appended ROM check...ROM NOT FOUND!</p>
    
    <p>No way to load ROMs found.</p>
    
    <p>I see that the guy who made this uses a Supercard SD, so I figure I'm doing something horribly wrong.  Might try another rom.</p>

    <p>Hi ! It doesn't work on my DS Lite with SC Lite with transflash :( I've tried to patch it with DLDI but still it doesn't work. Two white screens and nothing else. Any ideas ? Golden Axe would by great on DS, but don't know what to do. Everyting else works great: Spectrum emulator, SCUMM, even SNES.</p>

    <p>Ok, something I haven't been able to figure out is why the coder hasn't tried fixing the scaling problem.  The dimensions of the DS's screen are 256x192, no larger.  Every other coder has figured this out already.  I know this will not get posted because only the 'praise you' comments get posted, but at least it may get read by a mod or someone before it gets deleted.</p>

- :comment_content: |
    <p>synonymous: If I implemented bilinear scaling, people like you would no doubt complain because it will impact the speed. Right now it's using the built-in scaling from the DS video hardware, meaning it doesn't cost CPU cycles.</p>
    
    <p>As for the other issue, I didn't approve your previous comment because it had nothing to do with the GBA mode switcher post. It was just the same useless trolling, whining, and "PicoDriveDS is dead" speculation I've seen every month since I first released it.</p>

    <p>If FAT init fails for your cart, you probably need to download the <a href="http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/" rel="nofollow">DLDI</a> driver for your cart and patch the .nds executable using dlditool. Instructions are available on the DLDI page.</p>

    <p>To thebawp and c.hyjinx
    1. Patch file if needed
    2. to merge files with emu just write copy /b picodriveds.nds+romname.ext picodriveds-withrom.ext</p>
    
    <p>Works great for me ! Last night was Gods night :D</p>

    <p>Tried patching - am told the patch process is successful, but I'm still getting the same result.  Caesar, where do I 'write' this command - I've tried in the command prompt but I just get told it's incorrect.  Is there any documentation available for Picodrive, because I'd gladly look at it, but aside from RyanB's instructions in his original blog post (which I followed with no success) I can't find anything.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks.</p>

    <p>Sorry for the double post.  I downloaded 0.1.6 and it's working fine with no need to append roms to the file, so I guess I must be doing something wrong when I'm patching with the DLDI tool.  No idea what though, I downloaded scsd.dldi, used the dldi tool - pointed it to the scsd.dldi then at picodrive.  It reports that the patch is successful, and yet I still get the FAT init failure on my supercard.    I've tried wiping my SD card and reformatting and still get the same, so I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, brilliant work on this Ryanfb - I've never had much experience with the earlier Sega consoles...I find it somewhat ironic that I'll be rectifying that on a Nintendo console.  X)</p>

    <p>I appended the rom just like it says to with the copy command. When I run the file it says it cant find any appended roms. I'm using a crappy little Datel Games n' Music Slot-1 card. I plan on getting something better so its not that big a deal, it's just odd that it doesn't work.</p>

    <pre><code>          Load File

    <p>Been using 1.6 for a while, and it's pretty nice to be able to play classics on the go, so props to this emulator, its great. I just uped to 1.7, put some new roms, and Contra Hardcore, has many graphical glitches, but I guess it's one of those few that don't work well. Another problem I have is playing Sonic 3 + Sonic and Knuckles, it loads, says something about Opera Ram extension, but I can't get back to the menu using select, and I can't save. Other than it running kinda slow, works well. Also, I was wondering if sound will be implemented in some future release. Thanks again for the great emu.</p>

    <p>I've got this it work great on my DS Simply + M3 Lite, I think DLDI has to be the greatest thing created for the homebrew scene.  I have never got PicrodriveDS to run until this release.  One more thing tho, I don't have sound.  I'm wondering if it just isn't supported, or if I had a bad ROMs.</p>

    <p>hey ryanfb,
    wonderful work on picodriveds 0.1.7 runs smooth with all the games i have tested it with.... i have found that most of them appear to run faster then 60 fps.. i think that when you have the sound  working picodriveds will be able to run at full speed with relative ease i have a few sugestions for you i would like to see in a future release of this program and that is some config items down in the touch screen area and the ability to save my games as well as sound of course and if you want maybe some 2 player action over the ds wifi ... :) any time you need some one to alpha/beta test a release let me know i just might be able to help w/ some debuging as well  :)  here is my ds set up passcard3/supercard lite</p>

    <p>just a question: is the saving that is not implemented save-state saving? Or actual battery saving (ie. in Shining Force, you can save your progress to the cartridge battery). Because save-state saving isn't too great of a loss compared to battery saves!</p>

    <p>Working great here on a Supercard Lite (micro sd). Keep up the fantastic work on this emulator! I<code>ve just been playing through Golden Axe.. man, really brings back memories.. I used to pump serious cash into the arcade version of that back in the day.
    For anyone having trouble with the 0.1.7 on the Supercard Lite, do this:
    1.download the picodrive.ds.gba file
    2.rename the file to picodrive.ds.nds
    3.patch the file with brissou</code>s "SuperCardLite (SD Card)" patch using the dlditool patcher from...
    http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/
    This emu is really amazing so far.. so smooth.. I`m really looing forward to seeing a version with sound.</p>

    <p>Hi,</p>
    
    <p>After months of reading forums and searching someone found a way to 
    run this emulator on SUPERCARD LITE RUMBLE series. For some reason 
    each time a tried to run picodrive 0.1.7 I got white screens (even after 
    patching with dldi sclt.dldi file).</p>
    
    <p>So to run it on the SCLR card you need to install DSOrganize 2.5 and
    via this program run the emulator.</p>
    
    <p>I tried "street of  rage 2" and "sonic and knuckles", it works SLOW.
    I would like to understand if it is because the DSOrganize or the emulator
    works that way.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks in advance,
    Sallaboy</p>

    <p>Thanks for this! This emulator is shaping up pretty nicely :D
    we just need a bit more speed and this'll be perfect :) really. i love this. can't wait till i can play all my genesis games at full speed on my DS :D</p>
    
    <p>PS.: to make it work on my SuperCard SD (miniSD), i had to download the "picodriveds.ds.gba" file and patch it with the MoonLight driver for SuperCard SD</p>

    <p>I'm using the Supercard Lite (microSD). The picodrive.nds file just gives me a white screen, but after reading some of the posts here I tried renaming the picodrive.ds.gba file to picodrive.nds and it works great. Loading ROM files works, and I didn't even need to patch picodrive with dlditool.</p>
    
    <p>For people with Supercards who are having problems, it might be worth making sure you have the latest firmware. (You can get it from http://eng.supercard.cn/download.htm. Just run the .bin file the same way you would a .nds)</p>

    <p>Thanks for this release. Took me a while to get it to work, but I finally did. However, it's really slow - unplayably slow for me. That's not a complaint, if its just because its a work in progress then fine, but if there's a way of speeding it up, let me know. Do I need to be merging thingies with wotsits?</p>

    <p>I managed to get PicoDrive 1.7 to work with zip files.  Nothing fancy, only one file can be in a zip, but you can stored at least twice as many roms in the same space.  Source code is included.
    I also have a simple program to extract a zip file to your flash card.  Not very fast because flash is slow, but it has a sample code to show progress and will unzip all files with a zip to the root.
    http://s22.quicksharing.com/v/1101070/NDSUnZip10.zip.html
    Hope to see more homebrew and loaders use zip.
    I used the zip source code from here. 
    http://www.wischik.com/lu/programmer/zip_utils.html
    You need to patch the roms with the correct DLDI driver for you card.</p>

    <p>Hi, just tried your emulator on my DS, i have only had it a week, so after a lot of umming and arring, I went out and bought max media player. No regrets so far! Just have to say the emulator ROCKS! It loaded up Gods by the Bitmap Brothers just fine. I just hope you keep up the great work! Thanks!</p>

    I recommend "General Chaos" for anyone who's looking for a great game they might have missed the first time around.

Also the only other file not running that i tried was "Mega Man the Wily Wars" Once again RYANFB fantastic work. Kudos to your skills! I can only imagine the results for future releases.

    <p>Hi, I understand how filtering the image takes CPU cycles - but what about the GBA processor? Is there any way you can coax it into processing the image? That's all it would have to do. Or have it do some other work.</p>
    
    <p>I'm pretty confident that it's possible to get a near full speed MD emu on the DS with some form of filtering. The SNES emus run full speed, and they have to deal with more graphics processing.</p>

    <p>jack-o, could you describe what you did to get it working? Such as where you put the file on the card, what file(s) needs to be on the card, did you patch first then merge, merge then patch, not merge and only patch, etc. Details like that would be extremely helpful.</p>

    <p>I followed the steps there and it works perfect now. :) The problem seems to be that I was using the wrong dldi file to patch it. Instead of using the patch for "R4(DS) - Revolution for DS M3 Simply compatible" (which I didn't even see in that list) I was using the patch for "M3 Adapter (SD Card)" (since I use a Micro SD as the storage device I thought this was correct).</p>

    <p>i just tried PicoDriveDS v0.1.7 and it works, but no sounds and some games its slow (lags a bit) maybe i'm doing something wrong if you could help. i'm not even sure if this page if for people to ask for help or just leave a comment. sorry, if its not. i also look at your gba thing. there is a gba emulator for the DS that i use. its not great in fact i cant get it to work right at all. but if some one could make a user friendly gba emulator for the DS that would be great. that was more like a comment.</p>

    <p>I dunno which version of picodrive i have, probably this one coz i got my R4 card about 1 month or so ago and this works perfectly on it.</p>
    
    <p>only problem is the lack of being able to play sonic 3 and knuckles on it :( i read upwards that someone got a message saying that they needed to use the opera ram expansion pack or something but i never get that message...</p>
    
    <p>i have a ram expansion pack, so maybe i'll download this version and stck the ram in then test it and see if it works? anyone got any ideas if it will?</p>

    <p>Thanks for this awesome emulator, I'm usually pretty busy myself so I can understand your lack of time to work on it.  I look forward to future releases, whenever they may come ;).</p>

    <p>Ok, took a look at jEnesis. Doesn't look...well...terrible...but doesn't hold a candle to your work ryan. If you ever have a chance to update, I'll be in line to get a new version, but massive Kudos to you for an awesome job so far.</p>

    <p>Though disappointed by the lack of sound, I find this to be an effective emulator, though it does have some slowdown but thats the only major issue I can find.</p>

    <p>Does the NDS have sound-specific chips that can be used to handle or aid with the sound emulation?  Could these chips be subverted to handling other jobs?</p>
    
    <p>Also, I think everyone here would agree that it's better to have a perfect speed emulator without sound than a really slow emulator with sound.  Same with scaling.</p>

    <p>You need to focus on sound soon or else who cares about this even if you can play games. Without sound in the games the experience is totally lost.</p>

    <p>Nice emulator!</p>
    
    <p>I have to wonder though, is it supposed to be "frameskippy" because it seems to be a bit choppy. Maybe it's just me. Does anybody else experience this?</p>

    <p>Just played some Shadowrun. Bummer that there's no sound, but using the left trigger for reading actually works pretty well. Thanks for the nifty program, and good luck with future releases.</p>
    
    <p>Oh... I just noticed the dates on all the comments and newsposts... looks like this one's good and dead. Oh well :(</p>
