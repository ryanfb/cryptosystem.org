PicoDriveDS 0.1.4 is up! This is mostly a minor bugfix/enhancement release while I continue work on the new renderer. Changes:

   * Fixed bug where R could scroll past end of file list
   * Switched to unified builds, now one build should work for all SD/CF carts (thanks WinterMute)
   * Added NeoFlash MK2/MK3 support (thanks WinterMute)
   * Changed it so that pressing Select again without choosing a file will resume emulation
