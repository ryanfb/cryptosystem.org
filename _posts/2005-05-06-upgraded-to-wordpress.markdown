I have switched this blog from Movable Type to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). [Jesse's guide](http://www.squarefree.com/2005/03/13/switching-from-movable-type-to-wordpress/) was helpful. I had some trouble getting archives and permalinks set up the way I'd like them, but it should work now. Old archives links from MT should also be redirected to the proper location. I'll be tweaking the layout of the site over the next week or so as well.
